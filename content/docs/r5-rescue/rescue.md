# 歌詞 (中譯待補)

I lost my aim to find another reason
A long way to come
It was hard to find way back
Have courage be kind
I wish that I did
No praying to be blessed
Only I can save myself
That's the courage to step forward
The way you are
I wish it rescues all
Never hide away
Even if that lie to you but that's alright
It is never betray
Depends on how hard try yourselves
Why can't you see the ways repeat the same
Ceaseless streams of search to find
And that's the way of touch the way we are
You don't have to try to be a shining sun
The most beautiful thing is the moon
Reflecting the light
Someone said be strong you
Must be something
Be sharp to high falsehood with nothing
That's not belief
You had inside already you have
I wish we rescue all
Never hide away
Even if that lie to you
But that's alright
It is never betray
Depends on how hard try yourselves
Why can't you see the ways repeat the same
Ceaseless streams of search to find
And that's the way of touch the way we are
