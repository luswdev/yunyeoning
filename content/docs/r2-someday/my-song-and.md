# 歌詞 (中譯待補)

I made a song for you my friend
I made a song that I will sing for you
Filling my life with many beautiful lights
And a thousand melodies you're my paradise

I made a song for you my dream
I made a song for that I will sing for you my friend
Falling in love with every part of your life
Until the end of time
I'll love you more than my life

I wanna know you more
When you call me an angel
When you closely look into my eyes

Even though my love for you may fade away
I wanna give you more than words ever say
Cause I believe in you
And my song will fill the air when we're apart

Even though my love for you may fade away
I wanna let my words be true till the end of time
Cause I believe you'll never forget
And I won't forget the song in my heart
(the song in my heart)

Every time when I was down
You always came around
And your love of all light up my life

I am gonna sing forever
I am gonna sing forever
Close your eyes
I wanna give you more than words can ever say
Cause I believe in you
And my song will fill the air when we're apart

Even though my love for you may fade away
I wanna let my words be true till the end of time
Cause I believe you'll never forget
And I won't forget this song in my heart

I wanna sing for you my friend
I wanna sing for you with all my heart
I wanna sing for you my dream
I wanna sing for you my..
